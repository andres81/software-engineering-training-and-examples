# Installing and starting the Postgres image

## Step 1: Create the container

<details>
<summary>Create the container</summary>

```bash
docker run -d --name database-tutorial -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pw postgres
```

After the first time, using the __*docker run*__ command, one should use:

```bash
docker container start database-tutorial
```

</details>

## Step 2: Get a command line interface (CLI) in the container and login to Postgres (psql)

<details>
<summary>psql cli</summary>

```bash
docker exec -it database-tutorial bash
```

Login to the database:

```
psql -U postgres
```

</details>

## Step 3: Interact with the database with *psql*

<details>
<summary>psql cli commands</summary>

The command "\?" will give a listing of useful commands:

```

As can be seen listed in the list, the commands __*\l*__ lists the databases,
__*\c*__ will choose the currently connected database, and __*\dt*__ will list
the tables present in the currently connected database.

## psql functions

Psql also has functions that can be used, to gain more insight in the current
situation.

Important now is the function to get the id of the process attached to the
current session.

```psql
postgres=# select pg_backend_pid ();
 pg_backend_pid
----------------
             41
(1 row)

postgres=#
```

This will become important when testing different transactions. To illustrate
this, open two terminals, login and check that the process ids are different.

# Installing and starting the MySql server image

## Step 1: Create the container

<details>
<summary>Create the container</summary>

```bash
docker run -d --name database-tutorial-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pw mysql
```

After the first time, using the __*docker run*__ command, one should use:

```bash
docker container start database-tutorial-mysql
```

</details>

## Step 2: Get a command line interface (CLI) in the container and login to MySql (mysql-client)

<details>
<summary>mysql client cli</summary>

```bash
docker exec -it database-tutorial-mysql bash
```

Login to the database:

```
mysql -u root --password="pw"
```

</details>

## Step 3: Interact with the database with *mysql-client cli*

<details>
<summary>mysql cli commands</summary>

```mysql-client

mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql>
```

```mysql-client

mysql> use mysql;

Database changed

mysql>

```

### Last but not least: Process id of current session

```
mysql> status

The connection id is what is importan there, to see we have different transaction going on in the next lessons.
